# Upgrade Guide

## 0.3.0

To improve how errors are forwarded to clients, two `Writer` interface methods
changed from:

- `WriteError(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, err error)`
- `WriteErrorCode(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, code int, err error)`

to

- `WriteError(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, err interface{})`
- `WriteErrorCode(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, code int, err interface{})`

This has no functional implications unless you are implementing the writer
interface yourself.
